## Docker Port Dashboard for Easy Container Access

##### Dockpeek is a lightweight, self-hosted Docker dashboard that allows you to view and access exposed container ports with a clean, click-to-access interface. It supports both local Docker sockets and remote hosts via socket-proxy, making it easy to manage multiple Docker environments from a single place. Additionally, Dockpeek includes built-in image update checking, so you can easily see if newer versions of your container images are available.
